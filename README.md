# sonnets-to-json

I'm taking a Python course which recommends searching through archived Python projects on Freelancer.com. I found this one https://www.freelancer.com/projects/python/need-python-programmer-familiar-with-27775329 which requested a python program to convert the Gutenberg etext version of Shakepeae's sonnets to JSON format using regular expressions.

Most of the effort for this was finding a regular expression that would match format of the sonnets, which begin with a roman numeral for the sonnet number, followed by line breaks, followed by the sonnet text.
